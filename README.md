# worldtime

Show the current time in different cities. Highlight colour indicates:

* green: currently in working hours.
* blue: daylight hours, but weekend day.
* black: night time hours.

`config.py` contains the specification of which cities you want to check the time for, and what constitutes working hours for you.
